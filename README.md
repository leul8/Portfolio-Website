## Personal Portfolio Website

I have built a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The website is designed using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, providing a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

### Features of the Portfolio Website:

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Project Showcase**: Highlights various projects I've worked on, including descriptions and links to their respective GitHub repositories.
- **About Me Section**: A brief introduction to who I am, my professional background, and technical skills.
- **Contact Form**: A form that allows visitors to contact me directly for inquiries or opportunities.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: A toggle feature to switch between light and dark modes, offering a personalized user experience.
